 The leading causes of blindness and low vision in the world are primarily age
related eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), Diabetic 
retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma. It requires early   detection and treatment that can 
stop the damage. However, the lack of trained eye doctors to identify these 
diseases affects the care, especially in the rural and semi-urban areas, which 
involves an enormous scarcity  of experienced eye specialists. It is time-consuming 
and difficult even for ophthalmologists to diagnose  these diseases. Traditional 
machine learning methods, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have   
achieved great success in many vision tasks, such as image classification, semantic 
segmentation, and image synthesis. Automated detection of eye diseases through 
analysis of different types of medical images provides a better alternative for 
timely diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases. The steps involved in image 
processing based on automated diagnostic techniques are image acquisition, pre
processing, extraction of region of interest, feature extraction, and classification. 
The proposed model helps to detect the presence of diabetic retinopathy, age
related macular degeneration, and glaucoma at its early stages. It can alert the 
patients to consult an ophthalmologist from a screening standpoint. The developed 
model is less complicated more accuracy has been achieved
